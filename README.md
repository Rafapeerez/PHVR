### DESCRIPTION

This repository contains an API implementation made with SpringBoot for the management of phrasal verbs to improve my English level. It's just an idea as a side project.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Ensure you have Java 21 installed, if running locally without Docker.

### How to start?

Complete the .env.template file with the actual values relevant to your environment and rename it to .env. Make sure to keep this file secure and avoid committing it to version control, as it contains sensitive information like database credentials.

Then launch docker-compose.yml file using the following command:
`    docker compose up --build`
